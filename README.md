# UCR-CS120B-Final-Project
Final Project for UCR CS120B Embedded Systems

-Designing and developing a project based on the concepts learned in class. 
-Researching documentation for the implementation of specific components.
-Using specific programing practices for embeded systems (State Machines).

This project is simulating the childhood board game, Etch 'n Sketch. The components used for this project include: a joystick, a 16x2 LED screen, a Nokia LCD screen, and an ATmega1284.

This project uses custom programming for the LED screen, LCD splash screens, and joystick.
